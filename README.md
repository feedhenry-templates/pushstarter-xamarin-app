Summary: A demonstration of how to include basic push functionality with RHMAP.  
Community Project : [Feed Henry](http://feedhenry.org)  
Target Product: RHMAP  
Product Versions: RHMAP 3.7.0+   
Source: https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/pushstarter-ios-app  
Prerequisites: fh-dotnet-sdk : 3.+, Xamarin Studio : 5.2+, iOS SDK : iOS7+

## What is it?

The ```PushStarter``` project demonstrates how to include basic push functionality using [fh-dotnet-sdk](https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-dotnet-sdk) and Red Hat Mobile Application Platform. The developer should:
- enable push notifications in the iOS app within RHMAP, 
- enter required certificate,
- send test notification via RHMAP studio Push tab.
The iOS app catches the notification and displays them as a list.

If you do not have access to a RHMAP instance, you can sign up for a free instance at [https://openshift.feedhenry.com/](https://openshift.feedhenry.com/).

## How do I run it?  

### RHMAP Studio

This application and its cloud services are available as a project template in RHMAP as part of the "Push Notification Hello World" template.

### Local Clone (ideal for Open Source Development)

If you wish to contribute to this template, the following information may be helpful; otherwise, RHMAP and its build facilities are the preferred solution.

## Build instructions

1. Clone this project

2. Populate ```pushstarter-ios-app/fhconfig.plist``` with your values as explained [here](http://docs.feedhenry.com/v3/dev_tools/sdks/ios.html#ios-configure).

3. Open pushstarter-ios-app.sln

4. Run the project
 
## How does it work on iOS?

Due to the fact that push is very platform specific, you'll need to do call different methods for the different platforms. 
On iOS you need to do the following:

### FH registers for remote push notification

In ```pushstarter-ios-app/ViewController.cs``` you register a handler that will be called for push messages:

```csharp
  NSNotificationCenter.DefaultCenter.AddObserver (new NSString("sucess_registered"), (NSNotification obj) => { // [1]
    _isRegistered = true;
    TableView.ReloadData();
  });
  FH.RegisterPush (HandleNotification); // [2]
}

void HandleNotification(object sender, PushReceivedEvent e)
```
[1] event that is called to indicate that registration is complete
[2] HandleNotification handler to be called when receiving push notifications

In ```pushstarter-xamarin-app/AppDelegate.cs``` you finish the registration process and specify the deviceToken:

```csharp
public override void RegisteredForRemoteNotifications(UIApplication application, NSData deviceToken)
{
  FHClient.FinishRegistration (deviceToken);
}
```

### FH receives remote push notification

To receive notification, in ```pushstarter-xamarin-app/AppDelegate.cs```:

```csharp
public override void DidReceiveRemoteNotification(UIApplication application, NSDictionary userInfo, Action<UIBackgroundFetchResult> completionHandler)
{
  FHClient.OnMessageReceived (userInfo);
}
```
This will convert the message to use the same API as on windows and call the Handler that you used in the register call.

## How does it work Android?

### FH registers for remote push notification

In ```pushstarter-android-app/MessageActivity.cs``` you register a handler that will be called for push messages:

```csharp
protected override void OnCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
  FH.RegisterPush(HandleEvent);
  //...
}

public void HandleEvent(object sender, PushReceivedEvent e)
```
### Background notifications

When your app is not yet started and a notification 'wakes' it, your implementation of `FeedHenryMessageReceiver` will be called to handle the message. See `pushstarter-android-app/PushMessageReceiver.cs` for a exmaple.
